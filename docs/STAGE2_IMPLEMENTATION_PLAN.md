## Notes

- This stage focuses purely on UI/UX improvements
- No new CAD functionality is added
- All Stage 1 features must remain functional
- Design should be intuitive and professional
- Performance must remain smooth with new UI
- Mobile responsiveness is optional but should be considered

## Future Considerations (Beyond Stage 2)

- Panel docking system
- Custom panel layouts
- Multiple workspace presets
- Theme customization
