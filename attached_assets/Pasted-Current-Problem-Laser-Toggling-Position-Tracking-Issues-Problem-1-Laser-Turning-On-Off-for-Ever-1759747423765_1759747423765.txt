Current Problem: Laser Toggling & Position Tracking Issues
Problem 1: Laser Turning On/Off for Every Segment (Jerky Movement)
What's Happening:
The laser engraver is turning the laser on (M3) and off (M5) for every single segment of a continuous shape (circles, freehand paths), causing:

Jerky, stuttering movement instead of smooth cutting
Significantly slower engraving speed
Poor quality cuts with visible start/stop marks at each segment
Expected Behavior:
Laser should turn ON once at the start of a continuous shape
Laser should stay ON while drawing all segments of that shape
Laser should turn OFF once at the end of the shape
Movement should be smooth and continuous
Root Cause:
Looking at the code structure, the issue likely exists in:

File: frontend/src/utils/firmwareGcodeGenerators.js (lines ~135-180)

The current code architecture:

‚úÖ FIXED: Laser control is now at shape level (M3 once at start, M5 once at end)
‚ùå STILL BROKEN: Individual path segments may still be getting laser commands if they're generated elsewhere
Where to investigate:

Check the shape generation logic in frontend/src/components/EngravingToolsWindow.jsx:

Line ~200-300: How are circles/freehand paths being converted to G-code?
Are they calling generateLaserControl() for each segment?
Check the buffer transmission in frontend/src/components/GcodeBufferWindow.jsx:

Lines ~220-260: The buffer detects continuous movement but doesn't prevent laser toggles
It only adjusts timing delays, not the actual commands
Check path conversion utilities:

frontend/src/utils/svgUtils.js: How SVG paths are parsed into segments
Are segments being treated as separate shapes?
The Critical Issue:
Even though firmwareGcodeGenerators.js now adds M3/M5 at shape boundaries, something upstream is still generating individual shapes for each segment instead of treating a circle/path as a single shape.

Example of what's happening:

; Circle (should be ONE shape)
G0 X10 Y10      ; Move to start
M3 S1000        ; Laser ON ‚úì (correct)
G1 X11 Y10      ; Segment 1
M5              ; Laser OFF ‚úó (WRONG - this shouldn't be here!)
M3 S1000        ; Laser ON ‚úó (WRONG - this shouldn't be here!)
G1 X12 Y10      ; Segment 2
M5              ; Laser OFF ‚úó (WRONG)
M3 S1000        ; Laser ON ‚úó (WRONG)
G1 X13 Y10      ; Segment 3
M5              ; Laser OFF ‚úì (correct, end of shape)
What it should be:

; Circle (ONE shape)
G0 X10 Y10      ; Move to start
M3 S1000        ; Laser ON once
G1 X11 Y10      ; Segment 1
G1 X12 Y10      ; Segment 2
G1 X13 Y10      ; Segment 3
M5              ; Laser OFF once
Problem 2: Position Tracking Not Working
What's Happening:
The machine position display shows X: 0.00, Y: 0.00, Z: 0.00 and never updates during movement.

Expected Behavior:
Position queries (? for GRBL or M114 for Marlin) should be sent periodically
Responses like <Idle|MPos:123.45,67.89,10.00> should be parsed
UI should update to show current machine position in real-time
Data Flow (How it SHOULD work):
1. Buffer sends: "?"
2. Machine responds: "<Idle|MPos:123.45,67.89,10.00>"
3. Companion app receives response
4. Companion forwards to main app via WebSocket
5. SerialContext receives message
6. SerialContext forwards to machinePositionTracker
7. machinePositionTracker parses and updates position
8. UI displays updated position
Where the Flow is Breaking:
Investigation checklist:

Are position queries being sent?

Check: frontend/src/utils/firmwareGcodeGenerators.js line ~165
Position queries are inserted every 10 commands
‚úÖ This appears to be working
Is the machine responding?

Check companion app logs when buffer runs
Look for position responses in serial data
Key file: companion-app/src/index.js (WebSocket message handling)
Is the companion forwarding the response?

Check: companion-app/src/index.js around line 100-200
Look for serial_data message type being sent to main app
The companion should forward ALL serial responses, including position data
Is SerialContext receiving it?

Check: frontend/src/contexts/SerialContext.jsx line ~82-100
Look for case 'serial_data': handler
‚úÖ Code exists to parse position responses
Is the position being parsed correctly?

Check: frontend/src/utils/machinePositionTracker.js line ~65-95
The parsePositionResponse() function should handle both GRBL and Marlin formats
‚úÖ Parser looks correct
Is the GcodeBufferWindow forwarding responses?

Check: frontend/src/components/GcodeBufferWindow.jsx line ~50-70
‚úÖ Code was recently added to forward position responses
BUT: Uses dynamic import which may cause timing issues
The Critical Issue:
The position data flow has multiple handoff points, and it's breaking somewhere in the chain:

Most likely culprits:

Buffer window is consuming the response before it reaches position tracker

The buffer waits for "ok" responses
Position query responses might be getting caught in the buffer's acknowledgment logic
Check: GcodeBufferWindow.jsx lines ~75-95
Dynamic import timing issue

import('../utils/machinePositionTracker').then(...) may execute too late
Position tracker should be imported at module level, not dynamically
Companion app not forwarding position responses

Check if companion app filters or ignores certain serial messages
Position responses might not trigger serial_data WebSocket message
Files to Inspect for Agent AI:
Priority 1: Laser Toggling Issue
frontend/src/components/EngravingToolsWindow.jsx (lines 200-400)

Check how handleEngrave() converts canvas objects to shapes array
Look for circle/path generation logic
See if each segment becomes a separate "shape"
frontend/src/utils/svgUtils.js

Check parseSVGPath() and related functions
See how continuous paths are split into segments
Priority 2: Position Tracking Issue
frontend/src/components/GcodeBufferWindow.jsx (lines 40-100)

Fix dynamic import issue
Ensure position responses bypass acknowledgment wait
Verify forwarding to position tracker
companion-app/src/index.js (WebSocket handlers)

Verify serial data forwarding logic
Check if position responses are being sent to main app
frontend/src/contexts/SerialContext.jsx (lines 80-130)

Verify serial_data handler processes position responses
Check if data reaches machinePositionTracker
Quick Test to Confirm Issues:
Test 1: Laser Toggling
Generate G-code for a simple circle
Open G-code buffer window
Count how many M3 and M5 commands appear
Expected: 1 M3 and 1 M5
Actual (broken): Multiple M3/M5 pairs
Test 2: Position Tracking
Connect to machine
Send a simple jog command: G1 X10 F1000
Check browser console for:
üìç [BUFFER] Position query sent
üìç [POSITION] Parsing response
‚úÖ [POSITION] Updated position
Expected: All three log messages appear
Actual (broken): Messages missing or position not updating
